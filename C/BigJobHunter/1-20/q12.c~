Q12.
Write an one-line C function that determines whether a given number is a power of two or not.

Logic:
Any power of 2 will be in the form 1000000...
while that (number-1) will be like 0111111...
Their AND operation will always give a zero. 

What about false positives? No other case will give the same pattern. Think about it.
